Recall uses webhooks to push data or notify your server when certain events happen.

There are a few different types of webhooks to be aware of. You may find yourself using some, none, or all of these depending on your application and use case.

## Status Changes   [Skip link to Status Changes](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/webhooks-overview\#status-changes)

These are sent using Svix and can be setup via your [Recall Webhook Dashboard](https://api.recall.ai/dashboard/webhooks/). These include the following

- **[Bot Status Change Events](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/bot-status-change-events)**
- **[Recording Webhooks](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/recording-webhooks)**

## Calendar Integration   [Skip link to Calendar Integration](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/webhooks-overview\#calendar-integration)

## Realtime Endpoints   [Skip link to Realtime Endpoints](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/webhooks-overview\#realtime-endpoints)

These are used to deliver data from bots in realtime, these must be configured on a per bot basis via the [Create Bot](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) endpoint. They are not configurable via the Recall webhook dashboard.
