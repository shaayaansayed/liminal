- **Slack Application**: A Slack developer application created via the [Slack API dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) that can be authorized by individual end-users.

## Extended Functionality   [Skip link to Extended Functionality](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/overview-of-private-channel-support-for-slack-huddles\#extended-functionality)

Extending your Slack team integration with a Slack application enables comprehensive workspace monitoring. In private channels or groups where the bot isn't invited, it will request huddle access through a native Slack popup, similar to waiting rooms in video conferencing platforms. This optional feature requires individual user authorization via a Slack developer application, while maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.
