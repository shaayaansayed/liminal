### Retrieving Meeting Action Items From Zoom Meetings   [Skip link to Retrieving Meeting Action Items From Zoom Meetings](https://docs.recall.ai/page/tutorials\#retrieving-meeting-action-items-from-zoom-meetings)

This application demonstrates how to use Recall.ai‚Äôs API to deploy a bot to your Zoom meetings and extract actionable insights from the meeting transcript. By integrating with OpenAI's GPT-4, the app can analyze the transcript to identify key action items discussed during the meeting, ensuring you never miss important details even if you lose focus during the call. The frontend is built with React, and the backend uses Node.js and Express to handle interactions with Recall.ai and OpenAI.

### Real-Time Meeting Summaries From Zoom Meetings   [Skip link to Real-Time Meeting Summaries From Zoom Meetings](https://docs.recall.ai/page/tutorials\#real-time-meeting-summaries-from-zoom-meetings)

This application serves as a boilerplate Zoom Meeting assistant built using Recall.ai, Anthropic's Claude API, and the Zoom Apps SDK. It uses an automated Zoom Meeting client to generate a transcript, request a summary, and provide the summary back to the user in the meeting in near real time. The frontend is built with React, and the backend uses Node.js and Express to handle interactions with Recall.ai and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude API.
