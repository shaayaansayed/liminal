# Setup   [Skip link to Setup](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams\#setup)

> ## âœ…  No setup needed
>
> Teams Web bots work "out-of-the-box," no setup or configuration needed.

# Recording Behavior   [Skip link to Recording Behavior](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams\#recording-behavior)

**No recording permission** is needed for Microsoft Teams calls.

This means that as long as the bot is in the call, it will be able to record.

# Joining & Lobby Behavior   [Skip link to Joining & Lobby Behavior](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams\#joining--lobby-behavior)

By default, Microsoft Teams bots will need to be let in from the lobby, though this behavior can be overridden by Teams organization settings.

Authenticated Teams bots are still subject to any lobby settings enabled by the host. For instance, the host can still require that _all_ participants enter through the waiting room.

_For additional details on Teams Lobby settings, please see the official [Teams documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/who-can-bypass-meeting-lobby?utm_source=chatgpt.com) on this topic._

> ## ðŸ“˜  Best practices
>
> Due to the above behavior, users may run into scenarios where they're unable to let in their own bot from the lobby (for example, when attending external meetings).
>
> To ensure that a participant with the appropriate permissions allows the bot into the call, we recommend that end users notify the host of the meeting in advance that they plan to bring a notetaker to the meeting.
