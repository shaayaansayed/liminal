# Recording Behavior   [Skip link to Recording Behavior](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/google-meet\#recording-behavior)

**No recording permission** is needed for Google Meet calls.

This means that as long as the bot is in the call, it will be able to record.

# Joining Behavior   [Skip link to Joining Behavior](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/google-meet\#joining-behavior)

By default, Google Meet bots need to be **manually admitted** into calls and will be an "anonymous" user.

**When a bot attempts to join a Google Meet call, this dialog will be displayed to participants:**

Any signed in participant in the host's Google Workspace can let the bot in.

If you want the bot to automatically join Google Meet calls, the bot must be [Authenticated](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/google-meet-login-getting-started).

Authenticated bots are still subject to any waiting room settings enabled by the host.

A [Google Meet livestream](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308630?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) allows users to broadcast a video meeting to a large audience in a view-only format. This is particularly useful for events where interaction is not required from the viewers, such as webinars.

Google meet livestreams are currently not supported.
