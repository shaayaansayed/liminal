Recall offers transcripts generated by native meeting captions for no additional charge. This transcription method may be particularly attractive for those looking for an economical solution for generating transcripts.

**Pros:**

- No additional charge
- Perfectly diarized: since the transcript is directly based on the underlying separated audio streams, you get perfect diarization out-of-the-box.

**Cons:**

- No per-word timestamps
- Can be lower quality depending on the meeting platform
- Language cannot be auto-detected

* * *

## 1\. Start a meeting   [Skip link to 1. Start a meeting](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#1-start-a-meeting)

Start [instant meeting](https://meet.google.com/) and copy the URL.

## 2\. Configure and create the bot   [Skip link to 2. Configure and create the bot](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#2-configure-and-create-the-bot)

Call [Create Bot](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) while providing the `recording_config.transcript.provider` with a `meeting_captions` object:

cURL

```rdmd-code lang-curl theme-light

curl --request POST \
     --url https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/ \
     --header "Authorization: $RECALLAI_API_KEY" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data '
{
  "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/sft-iwmv-eur",
  "recording_config": {
    "transcript": {
      "provider": {
        "meeting_captions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
'

```

## 3\. Speak for a bit   [Skip link to 3. Speak for a bit](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#3-speak-for-a-bit)

After the bot joins the call, talk for a bit with your mic unmuted and then end the call.

## 4\. Fetch the transcript   [Skip link to 4. Fetch the transcript](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#4-fetch-the-transcript)

> ## 📘  Tip: The `transcript.done` event
>
> While you can receive meeting captions in real-time, if you just want to fetch the entire transcript after the call, you can do this after receiving the `transcript.done` [Webhook Event](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/recording-webhooks).

Call the [Retrieve Bot](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_retrieve) endpoint using the ID of the bot:

cURL

```rdmd-code lang-curl theme-light

curl --request GET \
     --url https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/2e8ec5a4-a608-4ea0-b9d0-2a12aec3f0f0/ \
     --header "Authorization: $RECALLAI_API_KEY" \
     --header "accept: application/json"

```

In the response's `recordings`, the bot's recording will have a transcript object in its `media_shortcuts.transcript`:

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
  "id": "2e8ec5a4-a608-4ea0-b9d0-2a12aec3f0f0",
  "recordings": [\

          }\
        },\
        ...\
      }\
    }\
  ],
  ...

Simply perform a GET request using the `data.download_url` to get the full transcript, which is in the following form (see [Transcript download schema](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/download-schemas#json-transcript-download-url)):

## Zoom   [Skip link to Zoom](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#zoom)

### Meeting captions are disabled in-meeting   [Skip link to Meeting captions are disabled in-meeting](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#meeting-captions-are-disabled-in-meeting)

If a bot didn't generate a when using meeting caption transcription, it's likely that the host had meeting captions disabled.

To allow participants to use meeting captions, meeting captions must be enabled. This setting persists across all Zoom meetings once it's set.

To enable meeting captions, navigate to **Host Caption Control Settings** while in a Zoom meeting.

![](https://files.readme.io/fee4d8c-CleanShot_2024-05-17_at_12.07.54.png)

Then, enable the setting called **Allow Closed Captioning for this meeting**

![](https://files.readme.io/52cf771-CleanShot_2024-05-17_at_12.09.49.png)

### Meeting captions are disabled globally   [Skip link to Meeting captions are disabled globally](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#meeting-captions-are-disabled-globally)

If the user doesn't see an option to enable meeting captions in their Zoom client, they likely have the setting turned off globally.

To resolve this, simply go to [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting) and flip the toggle for **Automated captions**

### Meeting captions can only be enabled by hosts   [Skip link to Meeting captions can only be enabled by hosts](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#meeting-captions-can-only-be-enabled-by-hosts)

If a bot did not generate a transcript with meeting captions enabled in the Zoom settings, it is possible that permission to enable meeting captions is only granted to the Host/Co-host of the meeting.

![](https://files.readme.io/726a5441bfc2e91ebb5a2f9fa2c729490005c95d4d0ae9f179b4425b5770684c-image.png)

To resolve this, simply go to [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting) and _disable_ the toggle for **Allow only the following users to enable captions for the meeting or webinar**

## Microsoft Teams   [Skip link to Microsoft Teams](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#microsoft-teams)

### Live captions are disabled in meetings   [Skip link to Live captions are disabled in meetings](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#live-captions-are-disabled-in-meetings)

If a meeting-caption-based transcript isn't being generated for Microsoft Teams, it's likely that the end user has closed captions disabled for their meetings.

This may also be set at the organization level, so if their setting is reflected appropriately they should check with their admin.

![Enabling Microsoft Teams Closed Captions  This ensures Microsoft Teams bots can generate transcripts when using `meeting_captions` as the transcription provider.](https://files.readme.io/d60623c-CleanShot_2024-08-05_at_09.09.25.png)

Enabling Microsoft Teams Closed Captions

This ensures Microsoft Teams bots can generate transcripts when using `meeting_captions` as the transcription provider.

### Participant has disabled meeting captions identification   [Skip link to Participant has disabled meeting captions identification](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#participant-has-disabled-meeting-captions-identification)

If a meeting-caption-based transcript is missing captions for some participants in Microsoft Teams, it's likely that the end user has disabled identification for their [meeting captions and transcripts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Ensure that this setting is enabled for all participants that you want to store captions for.

### User enabled real-time text causes meeting captions to stop working   [Skip link to User enabled real-time text causes meeting captions to stop working](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#user-enabled-real-time-text-causes-meeting-captions-to-stop-working)

Enabling the Real-time text (RTT) feature in Microsoft Teams (as described [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/use-real-time-text-rtt-in-microsoft-teams-37719c3f-1083-4ce5-ba82-ec92a27c21b0)) causes captions to stop coming through. This will prevent Recall from capturing transcriptions

# Language support   [Skip link to Language support](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#language-support)

> ## 📘
>
> Meeting platforms' meeting captions currently don't support automatic language detection, and the language typically must be specified by either the host (Zoom/Microsoft Teams), or the end participant themselves (Google Meet).

## Zoom   [Skip link to Zoom](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#zoom-1)

Zoom meeting captions are generated according to the language specified by the host.

## Google Meet   [Skip link to Google Meet](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-caption-transcription\#google-meet)

Google Meet captions are generated according to the language specified by each individual user. By default, bots default to English.

>
> - Setting up [Signed-In Google Meet Bots](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/google-meet-login-getting-started)
> - Signing into the account you just set up
> - Joining a google meet meeting while signed into that account, and setting the language to your desired language
>
> This will persist for any of the bots meetings using this Google login.
