# Recordings   [Skip link to Recordings](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/recordings-and-media\#recordings)

Recordings are the fundamental entity for capturing and storing conversation data.

A recording serves as a container that encapsulates various types of conversation data and metadata, providing both real-time data streams through [Real-Time Endpoints](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/real-time-endpoints) and comprehensive snapshots of meetings or interactions through Media objects.

Recordings can be generated through a variety of data sources, such a [Meeting Bots](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/bot-overview) and the [Desktop SDK](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/desktop-sdk-beta).

# Media   [Skip link to Media](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/recordings-and-media\#media)

Media refers to the different types of data produced by a recording. Each captures a distinct aspect of the conversation, enabling targeted use cases such as transcription analysis, participant behavior tracking, or meeting playback.

Media object expose the data captured by them through the `data` field including [download urls](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/download-urls) for various cases. These are available once a media object is complete (i.e it has transitioned to the `done` status).

Some examples can be found below.

## **Transcript**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/recordings-and-media\#transcript)
