title: "Bypass the Teams Lobby"
---

There are two ways for Microsoft Teams bots to be able to bypass the lobby:

1. Authenticate bots using [Microsoft Teams Bot Login](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams-bot-login-getting-started)
2. Have the end user allow everyone to bypass the lobby

**Below shows the Microsoft Teams settings for lobby behavior**

- **Green:** Bots will be able to join without authenticating if the end user changes their setting to "Everyone"
- **Red:** Bots will bypass the lobby only if they're authenticated, otherwise they will go through the lobby
