By default the Teams bot will join meeting as guest participant. This can lead to bot not able to join meetings which only allow signed in users.

Recall supports authenticated Teams bot participant bot will sign in using credentials before joining a meeting.

> ## ðŸ“˜  Bot name cannot be overridden
>
> One important caveat to using signed-in Microsoft Teams bots is that they get their name from the Microsoft Teams account used to authenticate the bot.
>
> This overrides the `bot_name` parameter in [Create Bot endpoint](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create).

Follow these steps to setup authenticated bots for Microsoft Teams.

# 1\. Setup Microsoft Account   [Skip link to 1. Setup Microsoft Account](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams-bot-login-getting-started\#1-setup-microsoft-account)

_Since the authenticated bot requires global organization-level permission changes, authenticated Teams bots should always use a new Microsoft account_

# 3\. Configure credentials in Recall dashboard   [Skip link to 3. Configure credentials in Recall dashboard](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams-bot-login-getting-started\#3-configure-credentials-in-recall-dashboard)

Once you've setup the account, the last step is to configure it in the Recall dashboard [here](https://api.recall.ai/dashboard/platforms/teams-web). **We recommend doing this step first on your development/staging account before applying to your production Recall account.**

Add the `username` & `password` for the account under the Teams Web Credentials tab.

> ## ðŸš§  We recommend keeping Login Mandatory option turned off.
>
> The login mandatory option (if turned on) forces the bot to always login before joining the call. Due to authentication flow for Teams web this can lead to increased delay in bots joining call. We recommend to keep this option off, as a result bot will attempt to login only for calls where signed in participants are mandatory
