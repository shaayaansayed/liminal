If you want to talk to a human, there are 3 ways you can get support:

1. **Contract customers only**: Message us in our shared Slack channel. If you don't have a shared slack channel with us, but want one, [book a chat with our sales team](https://www.recall.ai/talk-to-sales).

2. Email us at [support@recall.ai](mailto:support@recall.ai).

3. In the Recall.ai dashboard, there is a chat widget in the bottom right corner you can message. To get to the Recall.ai dashboard, [login here](https://www.recall.ai/login).
