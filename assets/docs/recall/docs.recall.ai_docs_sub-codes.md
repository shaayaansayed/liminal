Sub codes are a field ( `sub_code`) added to certain [bot status change](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot-status-change-events) events to provide extra context.

Here's an example of a status change object structure:

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
  "code": "call_ended",
  "sub_code": "bot_kicked_from_call",
  "updated_at": "2023-04-28T08:51:37.741790Z"
}

```

Here, we can interpret this status change as follows:

- **Code:** `call_ended` \- The status change event category (Call Ended)
- **Sub Code:** `bot_kicked_from_call` \- The underlying reason for the status change (sub code)

# Sub Code Types   [Skip link to Sub Code Types](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes\#sub-code-types)

Currently there are 3 distinct sub code categories:

- [Call Ended Sub Codes](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes#call-ended-sub-codes)
- [Fatal Sub Codes](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes#fatal-sub-codes)
- [Recording Permission Denied (Zoom only)](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes#recording-permission-denied-sub-codes)

| Sub Code Type | Event | Platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Call Ended | `call_ended` | All |
| Fatal | `fatal` | All |
| Recording Permission Denied | `recording_permission_denied` | Zoom |

Note: Platform specific `sub_code` is prefixed with platform name (e.g `zoom_sdk_credentials_missing`)

> ## ðŸš§  We may add additional sub\_codes
>
> You should not treat the `sub_code` as an enum, as we may add values in the future without prior notice. We will never remove values without notifying all our customers and a long depreciation period, as we consider removing values a breaking change.

## Recording Permission Denied Sub Codes   [Skip link to Recording Permission Denied Sub Codes](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes\#recording-permission-denied-sub-codes)

Since Zoom bots have a few extra requirements to meet for recording, there are more places that bots can run into trouble.

When a bot fails to record in a Zoom call, the `recording_permission_denied` webhook event will include a Zoom-specific sub code that provides more context into the reason it failed.

These `sub_code` will be added to the `recording_permission_denied` event.

| Sub Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `zoom_local_recording_disabled` | The meeting host has their global user-level local recording setting disabled. [More info](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/common-zoom-recording-errors#the-hosts-local-recording-setting-is-disabled)<br>The host was _not_ presented with the recording consent popup. |
| `zoom_local_recording_request_disabled` | The meeting host has their user-level local recording setting enabled, but the has disabled the advanced recording option labelled "Hosts can give meeting participants permission to record locally". [More info](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/common-zoom-recording-errors)<br>The host was _not_ presented with the recording consent popup. |
| `zoom_local_recording_request_disabled_by_host` | The meeting host has disabled participants from requesting local recording permission or has denied all future requests. [More info](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/common-zoom-recording-errors#the-host-has-disabled-requesting-recording-permission-within-the-current-call)<br>The host was _not_ presented with the recording consent popup. |
| `zoom_bot_in_waiting_room` | The bot is in the waiting room due to which local recording cannot be requested.<br>The host was _not_ presented with the recording consent popup. |
| `zoom_host_not_present` | The host was not present in the meeting when the bot requested local recording permission.<br>This only occurs in very rare cases where the bot â€‹doesâ€‹ request permission when the host isn't present. One example is when a host leaves/disconnects right as the bot requests permissions. |
| `zoom_local_recording_request_denied_by_host` | The host denied the bot's local recording request.<br>The host _was_ presented with the recording consent popup. |
| `zoom_local_recording_denied` | The request to record was denied by the user.<br>This indicates that the user has local recording disabled in their global user settings, the recording request popup was presented and denied, or that the popup was presented but the request time out. |
| `zoom_local_recording_grant_not_supported` | The meeting host is using Zoom Room or other Zoom client that does not support local recording permission. |
| `zoom_sdk_key_blocked_by_host_admin` | The Zoom SDK key used by the bot is blocked by the Zoom user's workspace admin. |

## Call Ended Sub Codes   [Skip link to Call Ended Sub Codes](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes\#call-ended-sub-codes)

The `call_ended` event signifies that a bot left, or was removed from, the call.

Recall attaches a `sub_code` to these events to expose the underlying reason why the bot is no longer in the call. This can be for obvious reasons such as the host ending the call ( `call_ended_by_host`), but sometimes its less obvious why a bot left a call.

Below is a list of all call ended sub codes and what they mean.

| Sub Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `call_ended_by_host` | The call has been ended by the meeting host. |
| `call_ended_by_platform_idle` | The call has been ended by the meeting platform, because it was idle. |
| `call_ended_by_platform_max_length` | The call has been ended by the meeting platform because it reached the maximum meeting length. For instance, on Zoom, the maximum length of a meeting when on a free account is [40 minutes](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0067966). |
| `call_ended_by_platform_waiting_room_timeout` | The bot could not join the call because meeting platform's maximum waiting room time exceeded.<br>For Google Meet, this is 10 minutes. Zoom and Teams don't have a timeout. |
| `timeout_exceeded_waiting_room` | The bot left the call because it was in the waiting room for too long.<br>This is the timeout specified by [`automatic_leave.waiting_room_timeout`](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/automatic-leaving-behavior). |
| `timeout_exceeded_noone_joined` | The bot left the call because nobody joined the call for too long. |
| `timeout_exceeded_everyone_left` | The bot left the call because everyone else left. |
| `timeout_exceeded_silence_detected` | The bot left the call because all other participants were likely bots based off continuous silence detection heuristic. |
| `timeout_exceeded_only_bots_detected_using_participant_names` | The bot left the call because all other participants were likely bots based off participant names heuristic. |
| `timeout_exceeded_only_bots_detected_using_participant_events` | The bot left the call because all other participants were likely bots based off participant events heuristic. |
| `timeout_exceeded_in_call_not_recording` | The bot left the call because it never started recording e.g. remained in the `in_call_not_recording` state for longer than [`automatic_leave.in_call_not_recording_timeout`](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) |
| `timeout_exceeded_in_call_recording` | The bot left the call because it exceeded the timeout set in [`automatic_leave.in_call_recording_timeout`](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) . |
| `timeout_exceeded_recording_permission_denied` | The bot left the call because it exceed the timeout set in [recording\_permission\_denied\_timeout](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) |
| `timeout_exceeded_max_duration` | _Pay-as-you-go only:_ The bot exceeded its maximum duration. |
| `bot_kicked_from_call` | The bot was removed from the call by the host. |
| `bot_kicked_from_waiting_room` | The bot was removed from the waiting room by the host. |
| `bot_received_leave_call` | The bot received leave call request. |

## Fatal Sub Codes   [Skip link to Fatal Sub Codes](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/sub-codes\#fatal-sub-codes)

When a bot hits a fatal error, a `fatal` event is emitted with an attached `sub_code` that provides more context. Below is a list of possible fatal sub codes, their meaning, and any recommended action to take, if any.

| sub\_code | Message | Recommended action |

By default, the bot is unauthenticated, so it cannot join these calls.<br>To bypass this error, follow the steps in [Joining "Sign In Required" Zoom Meetings](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/joining-sign-in-required-zoom-meetings).<br>For MS Teams, see [Signed-In Microsoft Teams Bots](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/microsoft-teams-bot-login).<br>For Google Meet, see [Signed-In Google Meet Bots](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/google-meet-login-getting-started). |
