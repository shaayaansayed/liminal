Microsoft Teams has certain tenants that do not allow bots to join their calls.

If you attempt to create a bot for a Microsoft Teams meeting hosted by a blacklisted tenant, you'll receive a `400` error with the following message:

```rdmd-code lang- theme-light
Tenant is blacklisted. More info: https://docs.recall.ai/docs/teams-blacklisted-tenant-ids

```

Since these tenants have banned all bots from joining their calls, there is no workaround for this.
