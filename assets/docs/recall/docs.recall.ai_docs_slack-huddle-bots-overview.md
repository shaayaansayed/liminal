## Why Slack Huddle Data Matters   [Skip link to Why Slack Huddle Data Matters](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/slack-huddle-bots-overview\#why-slack-huddle-data-matters)

Slack Huddles are great for quick collaboration—like incident response, brainstorming, or daily syncs—but lack native tools to retain or retrieve data post-conversation. Recall.ai bridges this gap by providing bots to capture transcripts, recordings, speaker timelines, and participant events, enabling automation, analytics, and AI-powered insights.

The Slack Huddle bots lets developers programmatically access real-time Slack Huddle data—transcripts, recordings, and events—to build custom tools. Some popular use-cases include (but not limited to):

- **Incident Management**: Automate logs and track escalations
- **Workflow Automation**: Sync standup summaries to Jira or Asana
- **AI Applications**: Generate summaries or analyze sentiment with NLP

## Joining Behavior   [Skip link to Joining Behavior](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/slack-huddle-bots-overview\#joining-behavior)

Slack enforces guidelines for bots in calls and conversations. Recall.ai bots manage joining and recording consent with flexible options:

1. **Automatically Join Huddles (Public Channels)**
2. **Automatically Join Huddles (Private Channels)**
3. **Request to Join Huddles (Public Channels)** \- Manually invite bot to join a huddle in a public channel
4. **Request to Join Huddles (Private Channels)** \- Manually invite bot to join a huddle in a public channel
5. **Request to Join Private Huddles (Between Workspace Users)** \- Manually invite bot to join a huddle in a private conversation

## Limitations   [Skip link to Limitations](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/slack-huddle-bots-overview\#limitations)

- Slack huddle bots can only join SSO-enabled workspaces as guests
- Slack Enterprise is currently not supported
- Bots will **not** be able to join workspaces with two-factor authentication required
