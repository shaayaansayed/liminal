Recall is available in a USA hosted region (North Virginia), a EU hosted region (Frankfurt), and Asia (Tokyo).

They are completely separate deployments of Recall, therefore your login and API credentials will be different for each region. Additionally, all API resources are region-local and must be accessed from the same region in which they were created.

The base API URLs for active regions are as follows:

| Region | Base URL |
| --- | --- |
| US (Pay-as-you-go) | [https://us-west-2.recall.ai](https://us-west-2.recall.ai/) |
| US (Monthly plan) | [https://us-east-1.recall.ai](https://us-east-1.recall.ai/) |
| EU | [https://eu-central-1.recall.ai](https://eu-central-1.recall.ai/) |
| Japan | [https://ap-northeast-1.recall.ai](https://ap-northeast-1.recall.ai/) |

Monthly plan customers can contact the Recall team via Slack to access new regions.

Note: If you are using api.recall.ai, it will continue to work for the US Monthly plan.
