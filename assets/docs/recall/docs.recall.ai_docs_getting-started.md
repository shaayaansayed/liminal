[Recall.ai](https://recall.ai/) is the API to get recordings, transcripts and metadata from meetings. We integrate with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and [many other video conferencing platforms](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/meeting-platforms). We also integrate with in-person meetings.

We support several form factors to capture meeting data:

1. [Meeting Bot API](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/bot-overview): Through Recall.ai's API and fully managed bot infrastructure, you can easily white-label bots and send them to meetings to capture the audio, video, transcriptions, and metadata from the meeting - all through a simple API.
2. [Desktop Recording SDK](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/desktop-sdk): Use our Desktop Recording SDK to get meeting data without a bot joining the call.
3. [Mobile Recording SDK](https://www.recall.ai/product/mobile-recording-sdk) (coming soon): Use our Mobile Recording SDK to record phone calls and in-person meetings.
