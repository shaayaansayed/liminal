Recall supports sending bots to registration-required Zoom meetings and webinars.

Few things to note:

- This feature is only supported by web bots
- For Webinars, bots **must** be added as a panelist

When calling the [Create Bot](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) api, you should ensure:

- The meeting URL contains the `tk` parameter. This parameter is automatically generated by zoom for all webinar and registration-required meetings
- The `zoom.user_email` field is set

  - Note: This email does _not_ have to match the email that was registered for the event. For simplicity's sake, you can provide a hard-coded email address such as `bot@yourcompany.com`
  - This can be provided regardless of whether the meeting is a registration-required Zoom meeting or not

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
  "meeting_url": "meeting_url", // Includes `tk` param
  "zoom": {
    "user_email": "bot@yourcompany.com"
  }
}

```

## Bot can't join email-required meetings   [Skip link to Bot can't join email-required meetings](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/zoom-webinars\#bot-cant-join-email-required-meetings)

| Bot type | Supported? |
| --- | --- |
| Zoom Web (default) | ✅ |
| Zoom Native | ❌ |

If a Zoom bot attempts to join one of these calls and isn't configured with an email, it will produce a `fatal` error with the following sub code: `zoom_email_required`.

To enable bots to join email-required meetings and webinars, you can provide a `user_email` in the `zoom` configuration object of your [Create Bot](https://docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_create) request:

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
  "meeting_url": "meeting_url",
  "zoom": {
    "user_email": "bot@yourcompany.com"
  }
}

```

If the meeting or webinar requires [registration](https://docs.recall.ai/docs/registration-required-meetings-webinars), this email does _not_ have to match the email of the user that registered. You can use any email address
