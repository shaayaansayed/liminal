Recall tracks usage as the duration the bot was active, starting from the `joining_call` event until the `done` event. This is because the usage is based on how long the bot server is running for

Bots are therefore billed for the time from `joining_call` event to the `done` event.

> Recall.ai doesn't round bot usage, and is prorated to the second.
